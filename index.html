    <br><div><h2>Hi, welcome to my page! Here is a little bit about me!</h2></div>
    
        <p> My name is Abby Lewey, I'm from a small town known as Cameron, Missouri. I've grown up in Cameron all of my life. I was raised by my parents, Susan and Jeff, along with my 2 triplet sisters Becky and Cassy. I have 5 horses, 2 cats, and a dog. In my free time I love to read, sleep, exercise, take photos, and ride horses. As a student at Northwest since 2018, I have learned many things in three years i've been on campus. I started off as a Computer Science major my freshman year and then decided it wasnt something that I completely wanted to do with the rest of my life. For the past couple of years I introduced myself to photography after I was gifted a canon camera for my birthday. I took the camera everywhere I went and it became something I truly enjoyed. As my second semester of my freshman year rolled around I switched my major to IDM, New media- Digital media. From here, I've been learning so much things that I have grown to love. From this point on, I use my camera and take photos of family members that request pictures, friends, and even strangers. I started off doing landscape photography, portrait photography, and now events such as weddings, and family photo. My years at northwest in this field are rapidly coming to an end and I will forever cherish what ive succeeded in, as well as all the friends that have helped me along the way.. </p>

            <h2><bold>Rico:</bold></h2>
             <p1><i> Rico is my Rocky Mountain horse that I got in 2013. He is now 18 years old! I call him "my old man" or "Ricola" (like the cough drop commerical) jokingly but he hates being called that and pins his ears back. Hes so sweet with a bit of sass, he likes humans but not other horses.</i> </p1>
